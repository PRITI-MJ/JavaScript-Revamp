Promise is a object which has 3 states:-
1. Pending:- when we request something from the server, it is in Pending state.
2. Fulfilled:- When we got the correct data, that means the promise got fulfilled.
3. Reject:- when we don't get any data or an error, means the promise is rejected.

Fullfilled means => If server replies back either there is no data in the api, still it will considered as fullfilled and not rejected.

When reject will work?
-> In case of:-
    1. Internet Down
    2. Server Down
    3. DNS Down
