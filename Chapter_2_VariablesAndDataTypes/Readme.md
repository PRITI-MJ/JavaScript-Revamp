So Why we use let and const keyword and not var keyword?
-> let and const keyword if once declared cannot be declared again unlike var.(which means let and const doesn't create confusion unlike var)
-> If a var keyword is decalred inside a function, then it can be accesible outside the function too which again creates a confusion.


Difference between const and let keyword?
-> if we decare a variable with let keyword, we can change the value of that variable by assigning new value to that variable unlike const.


Data Types?
-> 2 types - Primitive data type and Non Primitive data type

what are Primitive data types?
-> number, string, boolean, undefined, null, bigint, symbol

what are non-primitive data types?
-> array, object, function
