Difference between "==" and "==="?
-> in "==", whenever we try to compare between a string and number(eg:- 20 & '20'), JS converts '20' into number and then checks the equality.
-> But in "===", JS first check the type, if both are of same type or not, if both are of same type then it start to compare otherwise it simply returns false.

Javascript follows the rules of the ECMA Script.

What is the difference between & and && operator?
-> & represents BITWISE AND 
-> && represents LOGICAL AND
-> BITWISE AND performs "and" operations on Binary numbers
-> LOGICAL AND performs "and" operations on decimal numbers
